# Image_based_SearchEngine
 
Exploring an implementation of Computer Vision software using Python and OpenCV
The defined tasks were:
1. Collecting an image dataset of 5 landmarks (Example: Student Union, Lake Lasalle, Capen library, Alumni Arena etc) at UB Campuses using a smartphone. 6 Images were captured of each landmark(5 for dataset and 1 image as a query image)
2. 25 dataset images were indexed using the code
3. The accuracy of the search engine was calculated â€“ No of relevant results/Total returned results.
